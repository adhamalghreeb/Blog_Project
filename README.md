# Social Media Platform

The Social Media Platform is a robust API-based application designed to deliver a seamless and dynamic user experience. Leveraging the power of modern technologies, it allows users to interact, share, and engage with content in real-time. Built with .NET 8 for backend development and SQL Server for efficient data management, this platform ensures high performance and scalability. The integration of Socket.IO (SignalR) facilitates real-time communication, enabling features like live chat and instant notifications. This project showcases a comprehensive suite of social media functionalities, from user authentication to content management and interaction, making it a versatile solution for today's digital landscape.

## Technologies Used

The Social Media Platform incorporates the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Backend Development:** Built using .NET 8, a modern web framework by Microsoft that enables scalable and high-performance web applications, APIs, and microservices using C#. It provides improved performance, simplified development, and enhanced features for cloud-ready applications.
- **Database Management:** Utilizes SQL Server, a relational database management system by Microsoft, designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve data. It supports SQL queries, transactions, and advanced analytics for enterprise-level applications.
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO (SignalR) is used to facilitate real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server. This enables features like real-time chat, task updates, and notifications, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

## Features

The Social Media Platform offers a comprehensive range of features designed to foster user engagement and interaction:

- **User Registration and Authentication with JWT Tokens:** Secure and efficient user management, allowing users to sign up, log in, and protect their sessions with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations for Posts, Comments, and Images:** Full control over content creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval, providing users with the ability to manage their posts, comments, and images seamlessly.
- **Interactive Post Engagement:** Users can easily view and interact with posts, enhancing the social aspect of the platform.
- **Comment Interaction:** Engage with discussions by viewing, adding, and responding to comments, fostering a dynamic community environment.
- **User Following System:** Enable users to follow others, keeping them updated on new content from their favorite creators.
- **Post Categorization:** Organize posts into categories, making content easier to discover and navigate.
- **Real-Time Chat Functionality:** Leverages SignalR to provide instant communication between users, enhancing real-time interaction and collaboration.

## Important Frameworks and Libraries

This project leverages several key frameworks and libraries:

- **Repository Pattern and Unit of Work:** Used to implement a clean and maintainable project architecture.
- **ORM (Entity Framework with LINQ):** Provides object-relational mapping for interacting with the SQL Server database efficiently.
- **.NET Identity:** Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **SignalR:** Implements real-time communication for features like live chat.
- **JWT Tokens:** Used for secure authentication.
